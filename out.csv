"1218780","INVESTOR'S DREAM! Buy your first investment property (or 99th) at an affordable price with a LONG-TERM DIPLOMATIC TENANT in place for the next few years. This well-maintained condo has been leased to the same DIPLOMATIC MISSION for the last 6 years (lease is with the embassy directly - not the tenant personally), and the lease continues until 2022-08-31 at $1,731/month.
